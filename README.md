# OpenCV
### YOLOv11 Model Test
Dependency Requirements
- If not already installed, use pip install in windows command prompt to install ultralytics with "pip install ultralytics --user"

Device specific path change
- After having cloned the repository, open predict.py in the YOLOv11_custom directory and in line 3 (which is model0 = YOLO("C:/Users/OIS039/Docs/CEN3907C/Capstone-Project/OpenCV/YOLOv11_custom/yolov11_custom.pt")) change "C:/Users/OIS039/Docs/CEN3907C/Capstone-Project/OpenCV/YOLOv11_custom/yolov11_custom.pt" to be the path leading to yolov11_custom.pt on your local machine.

Running the test
- Run "python predict.py" in windows command prompt from the YOLOv11_custom directory

### Face Detection
To run a simple face detection program with OpenCV, open the
Face-Detection_Pre-Alpha folder and follow the instructions in
the README file in there.
