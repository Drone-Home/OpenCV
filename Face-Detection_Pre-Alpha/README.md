# Face Detection Using OpenCV
### Information
The sub_data variable in the create_data.py file represents the name of a 
folder that will be created for a particular person.

The face detection algorithm checks against these folders to determine 
whose face it is detecting.

### Instructions
So in order to create a new dataset for a new person, change the sub_data
variable in create_data.py to the name of the person to be included in the
datasets. Then run the create_data.py file to create the dataset for that
person.

Then run the face_recognize.py file, and it should work as intended and 
will be able to differentiate between different people.

Press the esc key in order to stop the program. Otherwise, if you close the
window, a new window will pop up and the program will continue to run until
you press the esc key.
